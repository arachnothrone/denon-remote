# brand:                       Denon
# model no. of remote control: RC-978
# devices being controlled by this remote: DVD/AV-RC
# the remote is a multipurpose remote control
# the given codes are for the switch setting:
#   AUDIO / CD - controls a DENON AVR-1803
# it is trivial to add new codes for other settings with irw
# Note: 0 and +10 are omitted on purpose, these keys do
# not produce infrared-signals in the AUDIO/CD setting
